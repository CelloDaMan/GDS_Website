    <p class="textBox">Hi! My name is <u>Marcello</u>, but you could also call me just <u>Cello</u> if you want, and I'm definitely a person. I started playing video games at either 4 or 5 years old and I've been very invested in them ever since. My first console was the Nintendo Wii and I immediately fell in love with it, fun fact, I still use my original wii remote from 2012 and it still works like new! Becoming a Nintendo fan from day 1, I heavily gravitated towards the Super Mario franchise and began to learn the history of it which made me discover my love for the N64 and Gamecube. Alongside that, I became interested in making my own games which led me here. Side Note: One of my neighbors dressed as a psychic with a crystal ball for Halloween several years ago and she told me she predicted I'm going to become a video game designer and now I'm scared that she's most likely going to be right. Ok sorry for yapping about all of that for too long, also I'm not solely a Nintendo fan I've explored a lot more outside of that to become an all-rounder. Alright rapid fire round let's go: My favorite color is blue, my birthday is March 9th, my favorite game is <i>Persona 3 Reload</i>, (if you like rpgs and/or story heavy games please play it it's so good) and my <b>LEAST</b> favorite food is spaghettios because they are disgusting and torture to the taste buds. I said earlier I started to want to become a game designer, but I also became interested in becoming a voice actor which is currently either my backup plan or maybe even a little side gig if I want to do both. I sometimes make youtube videos and also stream on twitch... sometimes. Yeah, balancing things is hard but when I get in the mood I really enjoy doing both. I do have a bit of game design experience when about a year ago, my friend group at the time and I started working on making a Pokemon fan game together that I hosted. The project got cancelled due to drama my friends in the group had with each other but my passion for that project was huge and I hope to put it to another game I might make in the future. Uhh so I don't know if there's a limit and if I typed too much so I'm gonna stop it here, but yeah that's stuff about me</p>
